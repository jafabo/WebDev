        <!-- Explanation about "Served by pod" -->
        <section class="pod-explanation-section">
            <h2>About "Served by pod:"</h2>
            <p>
                You might notice a unique message at the top of every page stating "Served by pod: POD_NAME". This showcases the power and flexibility of Kubernetes. Every time you load a page, it might be served by a different pod in the Kubernetes cluster. Pods are the smallest deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and can be thought of as individual instances of your application. This dynamic pod serving is a testament to Kubernetes' load-balancing and self-healing capabilities.
